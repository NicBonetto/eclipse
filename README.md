# Eclipse
A web app to discover new music artists through a chain of suggestions.

# Getting Started
This web application uses Git and Node, so ensure they are preinstalled. Then follow these commands in the terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/NicBonetto/eclipse.git
$ cd eclipse/
$ npm install
```
After all dependencies are installed, create a .env file with your own Spotify tokens, database url, and express listening port (CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, REDIRECT_URI, PORT, DATABASE_URL). Then run:
```
$ npm run dev
```
